        "In this digital age, securing data and communication has become a necessity. Approximately 328.77 million terabytes of data are created globally each day, amounting to roughly 120 zettabytes annually. This contains a lot of sensitive and confidential data that could be misused if sent as normal text. Encryption is one of the most useful, first-level layers to protecting your data. Encryption pays a crucial role in acheiving data security by converting plain text into cipher text that no one else but the people with a key can read. There are mainly two types of encryption algorithms: Symmetric key, and Asymmetric key.\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetric key encryption algorithms makes use of the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it faster and easier on computation. On the other hand, asymmetric key encryption algorithms make use of different but mathematically linked keys - Public and Private key - for encryption and decryption respectively providing better security, but at the cost of increased computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this report, we will look into two of the popular symmetric key encryption algorithms, **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES)**. Followed by that, we will also look into two of the most common asymmetric key encryption algorithms, **Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**. Additionaly, we will explore hashing and one of the famous cryptographic hashing function **Secure Hash Algorithm - 256 (SHA-256)**."

        "### What is Symmetric key encryption?\n",
        "Symmetric key encryption just like the name suggests, uses the same single key for both encryption and decryption of data. This means that whoever is encrypting the data must share the key with all authorized parties so that they can decrypt it. Symmetric key encryption is typically used for encrypting bulk data, as it is usually faster and easier to implement. So, symmetric key encryption is used when speed is the priority over increased security.\n",

        "The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Encryption (also known as Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block size of 128-bits.\n",
        "It is widely used to secure sensitive information and is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms out there.\n",

        "#### How does AES work?\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Steps for Encryption\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Dividing data into blocks:** The input data is divided into blocks of 16-bytes (128 bits).\n",
        "2.   **Key expansion:** The symmetric key is expanded to multiple keys which are used in each round of encryption.\n",
        "3.   **Adding round key:** The initial data block is XORed (Bitwise Exclusice OR) with the first round key.\n",
        "4.   **Substitution:** Each byte in the block is substituted with a different byte using a pre-defind S-box.\n",
        "5.   **Shift rows:** In order to further mix the data, the rows of the block are circularly shifted by different offsets.\n",
        "6.   **Mix columns:** To enhance diffusion, each column of the block is transformed using a specific mix column operation.\n",
        "7.   **Adding round key:** A new round key is XORed with the block after each round of substituitions, shifts, and mix columns.\n",
        "8.   **Rounds:** Steps 4-7 are repeated for a set number of rounds; 10, 12, or 14 depending on the key length.\n",

        "\n",

It was later adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The algorithm works on a fixed-size (64-bits) blocks of data using a 56-bit key.\n",

        "3.   **Rounds:** There are 16 rounds of processing in total. Each round involves:\n",
        "      *   **Expansion:** The right half (RH) is expanded from 32-bits to 48-bits using expansion permutation table.\n",
        "      *   **Mixing with the subkey:** The expanded right half is XORed with a subkey derived from the main key.\n",
        "      *   **Substituition (S-Boxes):** The resulting 48-bits are further divided into eight 6-bit chunks, each of which is processed using a substituition box (S-Box). The S-Box replace the 6-bit inputs with a different 4-bit output. This provides confusion.\n",
        "      *   **Permutation:** The 32-bit output from the S-Box undergoes another permutation.\n",
        "      *   **Combining Halves:** The permuted output is XORed with the left half from the previous round.\n",
        "      *   **Swapping Halves:** The left and right halves swap their positions for the next round.\n",

Asymmetric key encryption is often used for securely exchanging keys used in symmetric key encryption, as well as for digital signatures. While asymmetric key encryption is more secure than symmetric key encryption, it is also slower and more computationally intensive, making it less suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.\n",

They take input data and produce a fixed-length output, typically called a hash or a digest. The hash value is unique to the input data, and any slight change in the input data (even if a bit is changed) changes the hash value/digest. This property makes hash functions useful for various applications, including data integrity verification, password storage, and digital signatures.\n",

        "Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA-256) is one of the cryptographic hash functions in the SHA-2 family standardized by NIST. It generates a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from an input data of arbitrary size. SHA-256 is widely used in various security applications and protocols, including digital signatures, message authentication codes (MACs), and blockchain technology.\n",

        "1.  **Message Padding:** The input message is padded, if needed, to ensure that the length is a multiple of 512-bits (64 bytes).\n",
        "2.  **Initital Hash Values:** SHA-256 uses eight initial hash values (often called as 'constants'). Constants are 32-bit words derived from the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 prime numbers.\n",
        "3.  **Message Processing:** The padded message is processed in blocks of 512 bits each. Each block is further divided into 16 32-bit words, forming a 64-entry message schedule array.\n",
        "4.  **Hash Computation:** SHA-256 operates on a 64-entry message schedule array, using a series of bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), addition modulo 2^32, and cyclic rotations to update the hash value through a total of 64 rounds.\n",
        "5.  **Final Hash Value:** After processing all blocks, the final hash value is the concatenation of the eight 32-bit hash values obtained from the final rounds of computation.\n",

        "With tons of data being created every day, keeping it safe is more important than ever. Encryption acts like a shield, turning regular information into a jumbled mess that only authorized people can understand. This report covered different types of encryption, like the simple and fast ones that use the same key (AES and DES) and the more secure ones with separate keys for locking and unlocking (RSA and ECC). We also looked at hashing, which basically creates a unique fingerprint for your data, so you can tell if someone has tampered with it.\n",
